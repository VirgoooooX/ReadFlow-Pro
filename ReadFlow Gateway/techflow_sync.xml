<p>According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin. This story is almost certainly untrue, but it has led to a modern holiday staple: the white elephant gift exchange. These gift ideas will not only get you a few chuckles, but will also make your recipient feel (slightly) burdened.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>So you want to give someone a gift but you don’t have a ton of cash to spare. Don’t fret because first, you’re not alone, and second, there are tons of options to choose from. Especially if you’re looking in the tech space, it can feel especially daunting to find a gadget that’s affordable but also worth gifting — in other words, not a piece of junk that will eventually take up residence at the bottom of a drawer. But you don’t have to drain your wallet to get someone a cool gadget that will both be useful and make their lives easier. We’ve collected our favorite pieces of tech under $25 that make great gifts and help you to stick to a budget.</p>

<p>We wouldn’t blame you if you try to do all of your tech shopping around the holidays. That’s when you can typically get the best sales, both on relatively affordable gear and (more importantly) on big-ticket items.

Since we at Engadget test a plethora of gadgets every year, we know that there are some hidden (and not so hidden) tech gems at lower price ranges — you just have to know where to find them.</p>

<p>Finding a gift for the tech nerd on your list can be tough. They likely have all the tech they need and then some, but you can add to their kit with the right accessories. Apple, Samsung, Sony and other big tech companies all have affordable gear that comes in at $100 or less, you just have to know where to look. We&#39;ve collected some of our favorites, but remember: you can often find alternatives that are just as good (and sometimes better) than these. However, for the people in your life for which brand names really do matter, these gifts will speak to them.</p>

Each box on this list combines a bit of discovery with something tangible, such as gadgets, books, collectibles, snacks or clever projects.

<p>So you want to give someone a gift but you don’t have a ton of cash to spare. Don’t fret because first, you’re not alone, and second, there are tons of options to choose from. Especially if you’re looking in the tech space, it can feel especially daunting to find a gadget that’s affordable but also worth gifting — in other words, not a piece of junk that will eventually take up residence at the bottom of a drawer. But you don’t have to drain your wallet to get someone a cool gadget that will both be useful and make their lives easier. We’ve collected our favorite pieces of tech under $25 that make great gifts and help you to stick to a budget.</p>

<p>We wouldn’t blame you if you try to do all of your tech shopping around the holidays. That’s when you can typically get the best sales, both on relatively affordable gear and (more importantly) on big-ticket items. But it would be wrong to think that only the most expensive tech is worth gifting. Since we at Engadget test a plethora of gadgets every year, we know that there are some hidden (and not so hidden) tech gems at lower price ranges — you just have to know where to find them.</p>

<p>Finding a gift for the tech nerd on your list can be tough. They likely have all the tech they need and then some, but you can add to their kit with the right accessories. Apple, Samsung, Sony and other big tech companies all have affordable gear that comes in at $100 or less, you just have to know where to look. We&#39;ve collected some of our favorites, but remember: you can often find alternatives that are just as good (and sometimes better) than these. However, for the people in your life for which brand names really do matter, these gifts will speak to them.</p>

<p>The year may not be over, but 2025 is all but guaranteed to go down as one of the best 12 months in gaming history. Between releases like <em>Hades 2</em>, <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> and <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, to name just a few, there was truly something for everyone in 2025.

<p>Some moms really do mean it when they say they don’t <em>need</em> any gifts. But those same moms will probably appreciate getting something thoughtful and personal — a gift that shows you put in a bit of consideration. It’s tough to pin-point what that ideal gift is for any given mom, but we’ve got ideas to get you started. Since we spend our days testing and otherwise thinking about tech, most of the presents here have a gadget spin, but all of them are a heck of a lot more unique than a candle and a bath bomb.</p>

<p>Subscription boxes are the rare gift that keeps its charm long after the wrapping paper is gone. You make the choice once, but the surprises keep landing on their doorstep for months after that. For anyone who loves the buzz of a delivery, these are gifts that extend the season well past December. Each box on this list combines a bit of discovery with something tangible, such as gadgets, books, collectibles, snacks or clever projects. Some appeal to hardcore hobbyists, others to the curious or the comfort seekers, but all offer that same spark of delight that comes from unboxing something unexpected.</p>

The Bluetooth trackers are priced pretty reasonably even when not on sale, but they can be a steal if you can get them on a discount — like right now. A four pack of AirTags is on sale for $65 at Amazon, which is only a few dollars more than the record-low price we saw during Black Friday this year.</p> 
<p>
 <core-commerce id="3f2e8dbba5f04aee8fc64ab5334170d5" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D54JZTHY?"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>If you place an order quickly, the AirTags should arrive in time for Christmas, making this a solid choice as a gift for someone with a tendency to misplace stuff. AirTags can also be useful for people who travel frequently, helping you to keep track of essentials like your passport as well as a way to keep tabs on luggage while you&#39;re on the go.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>If you do purchase some AirTags, we have some recommendations for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">useful accessories</a> to go along with them, such as different styles of cases to best attach the trackers to different types of items. These are worth looking over and adding to your shopping cart in order to make the most of the product.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>AirTags have an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance and their replaceable batteries should last for about a year. They can also support Precision Finding, which gives more exact directions to a lost item, when paired with most models after the iPhone 11. Up to five people can share an AirTag&#39;s location, which is helpful for families or large travel groups.&nbsp;</p>

The Bluetooth trackers are priced pretty reasonably even when not on sale, but they can be a steal if you can get them on a discount — like right now. A four pack of AirTags is on sale for $65 at Amazon, which is only a few dollars more than the record-low price we saw during Black Friday this year.</p> 
<p>
 <core-commerce id="3f2e8dbba5f04aee8fc64ab5334170d5" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D54JZTHY?"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>If you place an order quickly, the AirTags should arrive in time for Christmas, making this a solid choice as a gift for someone with a tendency to misplace stuff. AirTags can also be useful for people who travel frequently, helping you to keep track of essentials like your passport as well as a way to keep tabs on luggage while you&#39;re on the go.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>If you do purchase some AirTags, we have some recommendations for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">useful accessories</a> to go along with them, such as different styles of cases to best attach the trackers to different types of items. These are worth looking over and adding to your shopping cart in order to make the most of the product. </p> 
<p>AirTags have an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance and their replaceable batteries should last for about a year. They can also support Precision Finding, which gives more exact directions to a lost item, when paired with most models after the iPhone 11. Up to five people can share an AirTag&#39;s location, which is helpful for families or large travel groups. </p>

Earlier this week, he also suggested he would tighten protest laws to scale back mass demonstrations to encourage &#34;a summer of calm&#34;.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">The premier confirmed he would seek to classify the chant &#34;globalise the intifada&#34; as hate speech. </p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">Two pro-Palestinian protesters were arrested on Wednesday for allegedly shouting slogans involving intifada at a demonstration in central London.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">The term intifada came into popular use during the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1987.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">Some have described the term as a call for violence against Jewish people. Others have said it is a call for peaceful resistance to Israel&#39;s occupation of the West Bank and actions in Gaza.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">Earlier this week, Minns, along with the NSW Opposition Leader Kellie Sloane, attended the funeral Matilda, 10, who was the youngest victim of the Bondi shooting. He read out a poem dedicated to the young girl at the event.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">Prime minister Anthony Albanese has announced <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn09p4kjj4wo" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc">a new gun buyback scheme</a> to purchase surplus, newly banned and illegal firearms. Hundreds of thousands of guns will be collected and destroyed, the government predicts.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">Around 1,000 lifeguards staged a tribute on Saturday, lining up arm-to-arm facing the ocean, on the shorelines of Bondi beach. Surf lifesaving teams at other beaches around Australia were photographed performing a similar memorial.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">Through the week, Bondi&#39;s surf volunteers have been commemorated as some of the <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxp998rd9ko" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc">heroes of the shooting</a>. Lifeguard Jackson Doolan was photographed sprinting over from a neighbouring beach during the attack carrying a red medical supply bag.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">Hundreds of swimmers and surfers paddled out at Bondi beach yesterday to create a giant circle to pay tribute to the victims of the attack. </p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">On Sunday, Australia will hold a national day of reflection with the theme &#34;light over darkness&#34; marking precisely one week after the attack started with a minute&#39;s silence at 6:47 pm (0747 GMT).</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">Flags will fly at half-mast and Australians are being asked to light a candle in their windows to honour the victims.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">&#34;Sixty seconds carved out from the noise of daily life, dedicated to 15 Australians who should be with us today,&#34; prime minister Albanese told reporters Saturday.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">&#34;It will be a moment of pause to reflect and affirm that hatred and violence will never define us as Australians.&#34;</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">Bondi&#39;s attack was Australia&#39;s worst mass shooting since Port Arthur in 1996, where 35 people were killed and prompted then-prime minister John Howard to introduce strict gun control measures.</p></div></article></div></body></html>]]></content:encoded>

Right?</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">But what's it like putting a question to Vladimir Putin - the president who ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the leader whose country was accused this week by the head of MI6 of "the export of chaos"?</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">And imagine asking that question live on TV while millions of Russians are watching.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">It's a big responsibility. You don't want to mess up.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">"My question is about Russia's future. What kind of future are you planning for your country and your people?" I ask President Putin.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">"Will the future be like the present, with any public objection to the official line punishable by law?  Will the hunt for enemies at home and abroad be accelerated? Will mobile internet outages become even more common? Will there be new 'special military operations'?"</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">While I'm speaking, Vladimir Putin is making notes. And then replies.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">He defends Russia's repressive foreign agent law. Hundreds of Russians who are critical of the authorities have been designated "foreign agents".</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">"We didn't invent it," Putin tells me. </p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">"This [foreign agent] law was adopted in a string of Western countries, including in America in the 1930s. And all these laws, including the US one, are much tougher…"</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">In reality, the Russian law is draconian. It excludes "foreign agents" from many aspects of public life, including teaching, the civil service, elections and public events. It imposes financial and property restrictions. Criminal prosecution can follow a single administrative fine.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">However, I'm unable to point this out to President Putin. The microphone was taken away from me after I'd finished my question.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">Suddenly the moderator intervenes to change the subject.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">"There's another question here: 'What's going to happen to the BBC? It's facing a multi-billion lawsuit from the US president?'," says anchor Pavel Zarubin.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">"I think President Trump is right," President Putin confirms.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">The Kremlin and the White House seeing eye to eye… on the BBC.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">Putin returns to my question.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">"Will there be new special military operations? There won't be, if you treat us with respect, and respect our interests, just as we've always tried to do with you. Unless you cheat us, like you did with Nato's eastward expansion."</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">Visible for all to see is what is driving Vladimir Putin - a deep-seated resentment of the West. </p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">He argues that, for years, Western leaders have disrespected, deceived and lied to Russia - and that they're lying still by claiming that Moscow intends to attack Europe. "What kind of rubbish is that?" declares the Kremlin leader.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">But many European leaders simply don't trust Moscow. </p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">In the run-up to the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian officials denied they had plans for a mass attack.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">More recently Russia has been accused of violating European air space with fighter jets and drones, as well as of carrying out cyber-attacks and acts of sabotage.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">But as he finished answering my question, was this an olive branch to Europe from Russia's president?</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">"We're ready to cease hostilities immediately provided that Russia's medium- and long-term security is ensured, and we are ready to co-operate with you."</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">However, if Moscow continues to connect its long-term security to its maximalist demands over Ukraine, European leaders will remain sceptical.</p></div><div data-component="links-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD"><div class="sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa kGPvxx"><div data-testid="links-grid" class="sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-1 gEjRXC jkjVgq"><div data-testid="chester-card" data-indexcard="true" class="sc-225578b-0 ezQaGx"><div data-testid="anchor-inner-wrapper"><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp89p082y2xo" data-testid="external-anchor" target="_self" class="sc-8a623a54-0 huZCWi"><div data-testid="chester-article" class="sc-cf565bcc-0 kwPVOm"><div class="sc-fa814188-1 iRoJZi"><div class="sc-fa814188-0 hPhBqv"><h2 data-testid="card-headline" class="sc-fa814188-3 iCfgww">Putin vows no more wars if West treats Russia with respect</h2></div></div></div></a></div></div><div data-testid="chester-card" data-indexcard="true" class="sc-225578b-0 ezQaGx"><div data-testid="anchor-inner-wrapper"><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0l0k4389g2o" data-testid="external-anchor" target="_self" class="sc-8a623a54-0 huZCWi"><div data-testid="chester-article" class="sc-cf565bcc-0 kwPVOm"><div class="sc-fa814188-1 iRoJZi"><div class="sc-fa814188-0 hPhBqv"><h2 data-testid="card-headline" class="sc-fa814188-3 iCfgww">Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with Russia</h2></div></div></div></a></div></div></div></div></div></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 21:19:25 +0000</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Behold Mark Zuckerberg: man of principle. Witness the Meta CEO's dedication to the most high-minded of causes: "currying favor with whoever's in charge." In 2013, when Barack Obama was president, Zuckerberg co-founded <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://FWD.us" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"></a><a target="_blank" class="link">FWD.us</a>, a pro-immigration advocacy group. For years, he vocally supported providing paths to citizenship for "the most talented and hardest-working people, no matter where they were born." Now, in 2025, with Donald Trump back in power and pushing draconian immigration policies, Zuckerberg's philanthropy organization has officially cut ties with the group. Who says Big Tech executives don't stand for anything?</p><p>On Friday, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-19/mark-zuckerberg-s-philanthropy-cut-ties-with-pro-immigration-organization-fwd-us" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">reported</a> on the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) severing its ties with <a target="_blank" class="link">FWD.us</a>. Zuckerberg's group provided no funding to the advocacy group for the first time this year.

The other, Ben Cohen,<a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdxw2ny2e27o" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"> has also hit out at Magnum</a> saying it was &#34;not fit&#34; to own the firm.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">In a statement a spokesperson for Magnum said the steps it had taken were aimed at strengthening corporate governance and to &#34;reaffirm the responsibilities of the Board of Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s&#34;.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">&#34;These actions aim to preserve and enhance the brand&#39;s historical social mission and safeguard its essential integrity,&#34; a spokesperson said.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">When Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s was created in 1978 it made its mark selling flavours such as Cherry Garcia named after the guitarist from rock band Grateful Dead, Bohemian Raspberry, a play on the Queen track, and the now discontinued Vermonty Python.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">Magnum said in its statement: &#34;We remain unequivocally committed to Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s three-part mission – product, economic and social – and its progressive, non-partisan values.</p><p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA">&#34;Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s continues to advocate for a range of causes and be a bold voice for social justice, as a glance at its social media channels demonstrates.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="links-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD"><div class="sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa kGPvxx"><div data-testid="links-grid" class="sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-1 gEjRXC jkjVgq"><div data-testid="chester-card" data-indexcard="true" class="sc-225578b-0 ezQaGx"><div data-testid="anchor-inner-wrapper"><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdxw2ny2e27o" data-testid="external-anchor" target="_self" class="sc-8a623a54-0 huZCWi"><div data-testid="chester-article" class="sc-cf565bcc-0 kwPVOm"><div class="sc-fa814188-1 iRoJZi"><div class="sc-fa814188-0 hPhBqv"><h2 data-testid="card-headline" class="sc-fa814188-3 iCfgww">Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s brand could be destroyed, says co-founder</h2></div></div></div></a></div></div><div data-testid="chester-card" data-indexcard="true" class="sc-225578b-0 ezQaGx"><div data-testid="anchor-inner-wrapper"><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y9glg2076o" data-testid="external-anchor" target="_self" class="sc-8a623a54-0 huZCWi"><div data-testid="chester-article" class="sc-cf565bcc-0 kwPVOm"><div class="sc-fa814188-1 iRoJZi"><div class="sc-fa814188-0 hPhBqv"><h2 data-testid="card-headline" class="sc-fa814188-3 iCfgww">Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s row deepens as three board members removed</h2></div></div></div></a></div></div><div data-testid="chester-card" data-indexcard="true" class="sc-225578b-0 ezQaGx"><div data-testid="anchor-inner-wrapper"><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g58xx1eero" data-testid="external-anchor" target="_self" class="sc-8a623a54-0 huZCWi"><div data-testid="chester-article" class="sc-cf565bcc-0 kwPVOm"><div class="sc-fa814188-1 iRoJZi"><div class="sc-fa814188-0 hPhBqv"><h2 data-testid="card-headline" class="sc-fa814188-3 iCfgww">Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s co-founder quits over social activism row</h2></div></div></div></a></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></body></html>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>From indies like <em>Silksong</em>,<em> </em>to AAAs like <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, and everything in between, 2025 truly had it all, and is likely to go down in the history books as one of the best years in gaming. But these are the games that felt truly special to the Engadget team.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="fa4f50fb-ca06-4b6b-a6b9-04f50921f722">Arc Raiders </h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IpeJjQDXNAE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>I’m genuinely shocked by how much I love <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1"><em>ARC Raiders</em></a>. I’ve never been very interested in the whole PvE (Player vs. Environment) genre, aside from some brief stints with <em>Destiny</em>, but <em>ARC Raiders</em>&#39;s sci-fi post-apocalyptic vibe just works for me. I love the <em>Blade Runner</em>/anime-like aesthetic of its environments, enemies and outfits. I’m a sucker for its synthy soundtrack and immersive soundscape. And somehow, I’ve just fallen for the game’s loop, which involves running out for resources and missions, and hopefully making it back home safe.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, I’ve had a few runs where I’ve lost all my gear, thanks to random online jerks. But even those setbacks kept me motivated to play. You can always head out into the world with free gear, so if you fail, all you really lose is a bit of time. <em>ARC Raiders</em> reminds me of playing <em>Phantasy Star Online</em> on the Dreamcast decades ago, an early multiplayer experience that’s genuinely been hard for me to replicate since then.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I sometimes explore maps just to soak up their architecture and environmental sounds. Sometimes I jump in to help other players, especially when they’re being harassed by others. Through success or failure, I can’t wait to head back in.&nbsp;</p><p><em>— Devindra Hardawar, Senior Editor</em>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="9c6cd602-ae7e-49d7-8448-29d9b8ac2ea1">Avowed</h2><div><div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrnW9dMo9RE" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts" width="1280" height="720" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Obsidian kicked off 2025 with a bang, introducing a fresh and deeply engaging fantasy RPG universe in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457220/Avowed/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Avowed</em></a>. It’s an expertly crafted and narratively rich adventure through mystical lands blighted by a mysterious fungus, set against a backdrop of political scheming, spiritual manipulation, colonization and resistance. The writing is stellar throughout, though the sidequests that reveal your companions’ backstories are particularly poignant. <em>Avowed</em> is gorgeous, its combat systems are fully customizable, its characters are intriguing and its encumbrance limit is generous. There’s a real sense of magic about the entire game — and no, that’s not just the mind-altering mushrooms talking.</p><p><em>— Jessica Conditt, Senior Reporter</em></p><h2 id="4f9049e9-d428-469d-95f6-d1e9b5b13836">Baby Steps</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WiP1BPBFb3A?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281040/Baby_Steps/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1"><em>Baby Steps</em></a> is a true walking simulator: Your left trigger controls your left leg, and your right trigger controls your right. At first, you&#39;ll be stumbling and comically falling every few paces, and it’s easy to write the game off as some sort of <em>Octodad</em> affair, where half the fun is dealing with the jank of basic navigation. But before long, you’ll find the rhythm and confidently pace through the game’s open world.</p><p>Of course, the challenge ramps up with your skill. <em>Baby Steps</em> has incredibly tight mechanics and a rewarding if punishing difficulty curve. Various surfaces and steeper inclines are introduced, and the game ends with a truly horrific mountain pass. Through it all, you’ll be treated to a light but touching story full of comedic improvisation from the game’s developers, who voice most of the characters themselves.</p><p><em>— Aaron Souppouris, Editor-in-chief</em></p><h2 id="4d8d1fb5-ce01-47b7-a90d-23024f9b26b5">Ball X Pit</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vsCA0zhV_Nw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>I don’t usually go in for roguelike-style games, but my colleague Kris Holt convinced me to try <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2062430/BALL_x_PIT/" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1"><em>Ball X Pit</em></a> and, in doing so, ruined my autumn. This is, quite simply, one of the most addictive games I’ve ever played. The base gameplay is rooted in classic <em>Brick Breaker</em>-style games from the ‘80s. Balls bounce from the bottom to the top of the screen, but instead of hitting and breaking bricks you’re bouncing them off a massive series of demonic enemies. There are eight levels and over a dozen different playable characters, each with their own distinct strengths and play styles, and the vast combination of upgrades you can unlock means no run will ever be quite the same.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps the most fun thing about it is unlocking the different fusions and evolutions you can find along the way. Beyond the basic balls that your character shoots, you have slots for special balls that do things like freeze enemies, deal extra damage or blind enemies so they can’t accurately attack you. You can combine those special balls into even more powerful weapons, and finding the best evolutions that work with each character and each level adds yet another layer to the madness. While you can easily pick it up and play for 20 or 30 minutes, I’ve found it pretty difficult to end a session without whiling away multiple hours. Think carefully about whether you’re ready to ruin your productivity for a few weeks (or months) before you dive into <em>Ball X Pit</em>.</p><p><em>— Nathan Ingraham, Deputy Editor</em></p><h2 id="d739b557-35bd-4e22-afd8-b4423616099e">Blue Prince</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jdRnQzfp2ks?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>My absolute favorite experience in all of gaming is when I&#39;m several hours into a puzzle game and I discover there&#39;s more going on than meets the eye. It&#39;s the moment where I realize an already-good game is in fact an excellent one, and I want to simultaneously curse the creators&#39; evil brains and applaud their brilliance. I feel fortunate if I have that reaction once during a playthrough. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1"><em>Blue Prince</em></a> provided me with that experience of total delight many times over.&nbsp;</p><p>The biggest downside to a game like <em>Blue Prince</em> is that it&#39;s hard to talk about. For starters, it defies categorization. Sure, there are some roguelike elements and obviously plenty of puzzles, but playing it goes beyond a single genre tag. And more importantly, the journey of uncovering its surprises is a big reason why this game is so special. If you haven&#39;t tried it yet, I strongly suggest you do so and that you read as little about it as possible before diving in. All you need to know is that if you enjoy burrowing ever deeper into a rabbit hole of mysteries and problem-solving, you must play this game. <em>Blue Prince</em> is a real masterpiece by creative lead Tonda Ros and the whole Dogubomb team. It earns all the hype it gets.</p><p><em>— Anna Washenko, Contributing Reporter</em></p><h2 id="3ed17ba6-1430-4248-8d51-6ae5e757911e">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1-V6-OuCVjE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p></p><p>No game I played this year has stuck with me the way <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2442460/Citizen_Sleeper_2_Starward_Vector/" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1"><em>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</em> did</a>.

Thankfully, the game itself lived up to my expectations, with a thrilling story, memorable characters and some of the most beautiful visuals I’ve ever seen in a game. Sure, its twists and turns might not feel entirely surprising if you’re an RPG connoisseur, but no other game captures such a specific vibe. It may not fully stick the landing, but <em>Clair Obscur </em>was certainly one of the most fulfilling narrative experiences I experienced this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>— D.H.</em></p><h2 id="8c75a876-b3c3-412b-b013-d03bf4064105">Date Everything!</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v2Rv9zX3K24?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>This dating sim is witty as heck.

Even the artwork is witty, transforming everything from a toaster to a treadmill into attractive humans in wildly clever and creative ways.&nbsp;</p><p>The second and most important reason I loved this game is that <em>Date Everything</em> is a cavalcade of virtuoso voice acting that must be heard to be appreciated. I&#39;ve played a bunch of visual novels without voiceover where the writing alone wasn&#39;t strong enough to make the characters pop, as well as voiced ones where middling performances detracted from the story. <em>Date Everything</em>&#39;s cast of 100 of the best in the business make their dialogue shine (and like I said, the dialogue is really damn good).&nbsp;</p><p>There are some endearingly obvious casting choices. The horny clothes dryer? Yeah, it&#39;s Neil Newbon, who probably charmed your pants off as Astarion in <em>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3</em>. Your D&amp;D dice set? It couldn&#39;t be anyone but Matt Mercer. On the flip side, Cherami Lee as perky Chairemi (yep, your chairs) was unrecognizable from her stellar turn as V in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. Laura Bailey has voiced countless heroines over the years, so the last place I expected to hear her was screaming her lungs out as one half of the toxic relationship playing out in your laundry room. Whether you&#39;re looking for love or laughs, <em>Date Everything</em> is a marvelous showcase of talents that often go underappreciated in gaming.&nbsp;</p><p><em>— A.W.</em></p><h2 id="6b104842-e66d-4e86-add8-63b2aa3b6094">Despelote</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oVdmFEG_MuI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Having grown up with grandparents from South America, I&#39;m familiar with a flavor of soccer fanaticism that hasn&#39;t quite taken root in the US.

There was something to do around almost every corner and some of the game&#39;s many secrets were well-hidden. That&#39;s not to say the game&#39;s plot is anything to sniff at: this is a brutal tale of revenge, featuring rich writing and performances.&nbsp;</p><p>The open-world format is a little at odds with protagonist Atsu’s steely desire for vengeance, but Ghost of Yōtei is beautifully orchestrated enough for that to be a minor complaint. The combat is stellar — to be most effective, you’ll need to swap between weapons to counter what your current opponent is wielding. Still, I couldn’t help but use the kusarigama whenever possible, especially to carry out stealthy assassinations from a distance. Strengthening Atsu’s bond with a wild wolf that becomes an ally in combat is also a highlight, while the deeply customizable difficulty settings are very welcome.</p><p>Like its predecessor, <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, this is a technical masterpiece.

The second thing to know is that you are no longer Zagreus, but Melinoë, princess of the underworld, and if you are a gay woman this game exists to roast you mercilessly.&nbsp;</p><p>Zag was a lovable himbo engaged in a petty dispute against his father and free to romance a variety of Greek gods along the way. By contrast the world around Mel is coming apart at the seams, and her dating options are considerably less satisfying. Several of her in-game relationships with women are written to be warm and reciprocal, but of course they&#39;re with the found family of deities who support her. Nemesis and Eris, her two options for romance, seem to actively hate her and, after dozens of runs, are never interested in anything beyond a threadbare situationship.&nbsp;</p><p>Juggling two different mission paths with their own distinct enemies and biomes is a treat — as are the new, sometimes brutally hard bosses.

You act as a set of pinching fingers that lifts and places shape-people in their preferred seats — on the bus, in a restaurant, at a movie theater and so on. Each person has preferences (window seat, no bad smells, wants to read) and attributes (forgot to shower, plays loud music) that mesh or conflict.</p><p>Tiny accessories and icons not only make each shape more adorable, they help keep track of some of their proclivities. Bubbly smiles or heartbreaking frowns tell you whether you’ve met a seated shape’s needs, and tapping on them tells you exactly what they want. A simple story involving a few of the shapes and an indie film takes form as you advance levels, but for the most part, you’re just checking in on what people want and arranging them to optimize happiness.&nbsp;</p><p>I obsessively plowed through the game, soothed by the strummy music, delighted by the plops, bloops and chatters of the sound effects. As more people get on the bus (show up to the coworking space, arrive at the restaurant) it gets increasingly tougher to satisfy everyone — more than once I had to clear everyone off the train and start from scratch — but achieving 100 percent contentment is always possible.

The game is an awkward first-person platformer where it&#39;s sometimes easier to shoot someone out of a cannon than it is to get them to toddle up a hill, but those obstacles feel good to overcome because the game lets you talk to people while you do it.&nbsp;</p><p>The term <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://aftermath.site/friendslop-peak-lethal-company-social-media-discourse/" data-i13n="cpos:33;pos:1">&quot;friendslop&quot;</a> was coined following the popularity of <em>Peak</em> and games like it, a burgeoning micro-genre where games with deceptively simple virtual tasks are paired with proximity-based voice chat.

It&#39;s so thoughtfully crafted that even the name is perfect.

Öoo is also the noise I involuntarily made when I solved some of the puzzles.</p><p>Nama Takahashi (who made Öoo with help from Tiny Cactus Studio and Tsuyomi) uses deeply clever level design to teach you how to use the bombs and move forward. Takahashi clearly wants you to succeed. Checkpoints are everywhere, so if you die while trying to find a puzzle solution, there&#39;s no lengthy runback to worry about.

Seven years in the making, from DLC to standalone game to Reddit meme, <em>Silksong</em> arrived across pretty much every mainstream gaming platform.&nbsp;</p><p>The <em>Hollow Knight</em> sequel swaps to a new protagonist, Hornet, who was a recurring boss in the original. She’s faster, she can attack in diagonal dives, and just plays pretty differently from the Knight. Off the back of the slowburn hit of <em>Hollow Knight</em>, Team Cherry have lavished more attention, more fun and more diverse boss battles, ensuring this feels like a better (although possibly more challenging) game.&nbsp;</p><p>I prefer the faster, risk-and-reward playstyle too. Hornet uses silk to heal, which, like soul in <em>Hollow Knight</em>, you build up by attacking enemies. However, Hornet does this in bulk, healing three hearts at once. When you die, you’ll leave a bounty of silk behind, making for a tempting health top-up you can grab mid-boss fight. If you don’t die before then.&nbsp;</p><p>You can equip Hornet with different weapon and subweapon loadouts, adding a little more variety in this sequel. Heavy, slower weapon swings, or relentless strikes with a much shorter range? Your choice.</p><p>When it launched, half the Engadget team were sharing tales of bottlenecks and seemingly impossible boss fights, and we were all exploring the world of <em>Silksong</em> in entirely different directions.

Hinako’s town is ravaged by demonic creatures and an infectious botanical fungus, and she has to fight her way through it, shifting among realities and encountering a cast of untrustworthy peers and fox worshippers. The combat starts out great and only gets better as Hinako sacrifices her flesh in the name of salvation, meaning the body horror steadily ramps up as the game progresses. Hinako’s world is filled with terrifying mannequin minions, bulbous pus monsters and disturbing, trypophobic visuals. It’s beautiful.</p><p><em>— J.C.</em></p><h2 id="bb35f1c8-c25d-4f1e-8031-1eb67c6a8c1b">Subway Builder</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-12-19_at_09.34.28.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-12-19_at_09.34.28.jpg" style="height:1281px;width:2560px;" alt="Subway Builder" data-uuid="f1d8d419-8d6b-402d-b1b4-89da04351e93"/><figcaption>Subway Builder</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Aaron Souppouris</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.subwaybuilder.com/" data-i13n="cpos:40;pos:1"><em>Subway Builder</em></a> is an indie transport sim like no other.

In dense cities like New York this is incredibly easy, but freeing even 20 percent of Phoenix&#39;s endless sprawl from cars without going bust is very challenging.&nbsp;</p><p>The game scratches the same itch for me as <em>Mini Metro</em>, only instead of cutesy vector graphics you&#39;re basically working in Google Maps. It&#39;s also expanding at a rapid pace: When I first played in October, there were maybe 15 locations, and as of writing there are now 29 US cities and, most recently, five UK options.

Combining delectable traversal mechanics from <em>The Pathless</em> and beautiful sea creatures like those in <em>Abzu</em>, the game is a culmination of everything developer Giant Squid is good at. More importantly, though, <em>Sword of the Sea</em>&#39;s surfing mechanic just looks and feels damn cool.</p><p>I don&#39;t know that I ever mastered how to surf on a sword during <em>Sword of the Sea</em>&#39;s silent and surprisingly brief narrative, but I do know it didn&#39;t take long to care.

That&#39;s not to discredit the game&#39;s other charms, like a score from Austin Wintory and a photo mode that&#39;s perfect for capturing close encounters with dolphins, whales and sharks. If you need a reason to play <em>Sword of the Sea</em>, though, let it be the surfing.

I’ve never been very interested in the whole PvE (Player vs. Environment) genre, aside from some brief stints with <em>Destiny</em>, but <em>ARC Raiders</em>&#39;s sci-fi post-apocalyptic vibe just works for me. I love the <em>Blade Runner</em>/anime-like aesthetic of its environments, enemies and outfits. I’m a sucker for its synthy soundtrack and immersive soundscape. And somehow, I’ve just fallen for the game’s loop, which involves running out for resources and missions, and hopefully making it back home safe. </p><p>Sure, I’ve had a few runs where I’ve lost all my gear, thanks to random online jerks. But even those setbacks kept me motivated to play. You can always head out into the world with free gear, so if you fail, all you really lose is a bit of time. <em>ARC Raiders</em> reminds me of playing <em>Phantasy Star Online</em> on the Dreamcast decades ago, an early multiplayer experience that’s genuinely been hard for me to replicate since then.   </p><p>I sometimes explore maps just to soak up their architecture and environmental sounds. Sometimes I jump in to help other players, especially when they’re being harassed by others. Through success or failure, I can’t wait to head back in. </p><p><em>— Devindra Hardawar, Senior Editor</em> </p><h2 id="9c6cd602-ae7e-49d7-8448-29d9b8ac2ea1">Avowed</h2><div><div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrnW9dMo9RE" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts" width="1280" height="720" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Obsidian kicked off 2025 with a bang, introducing a fresh and deeply engaging fantasy RPG universe in <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457220/Avowed/" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1"><em>Avowed</em></a>.

The writing is stellar throughout, though the sidequests that reveal your companions’ backstories are particularly poignant. <em>Avowed</em> is gorgeous, its combat systems are fully customizable, its characters are intriguing and its encumbrance limit is generous.

This is, quite simply, one of the most addictive games I’ve ever played. The base gameplay is rooted in classic <em>Brick Breaker</em>-style games from the ‘80s. Balls bounce from the bottom to the top of the screen, but instead of hitting and breaking bricks you’re bouncing them off a massive series of demonic enemies. There are eight levels and over a dozen different playable characters, each with their own distinct strengths and play styles, and the vast combination of upgrades you can unlock means no run will ever be quite the same. </p><p>Perhaps the most fun thing about it is unlocking the different fusions and evolutions you can find along the way. Beyond the basic balls that your character shoots, you have slots for special balls that do things like freeze enemies, deal extra damage or blind enemies so they can’t accurately attack you. You can combine those special balls into even more powerful weapons, and finding the best evolutions that work with each character and each level adds yet another layer to the madness. While you can easily pick it up and play for 20 or 30 minutes, I’ve found it pretty difficult to end a session without whiling away multiple hours. Think carefully about whether you’re ready to ruin your productivity for a few weeks (or months) before you dive into <em>Ball X Pit</em>.</p><p><em>— Nathan Ingraham, Deputy Editor</em></p><h2 id="d739b557-35bd-4e22-afd8-b4423616099e">Blue Prince</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jdRnQzfp2ks?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>My absolute favorite experience in all of gaming is when I&#39;m several hours into a puzzle game and I discover there&#39;s more going on than meets the eye.

For starters, it defies categorization. Sure, there are some roguelike elements and obviously plenty of puzzles, but playing it goes beyond a single genre tag. And more importantly, the journey of uncovering its surprises is a big reason why this game is so special. If you haven&#39;t tried it yet, I strongly suggest you do so and that you read as little about it as possible before diving in. All you need to know is that if you enjoy burrowing ever deeper into a rabbit hole of mysteries and problem-solving, you must play this game. <em>Blue Prince</em> is a real masterpiece by creative lead Tonda Ros and the whole Dogubomb team.

It instantly became my most anticipated game of 2025. Thankfully, the game itself lived up to my expectations, with a thrilling story, memorable characters and some of the most beautiful visuals I’ve ever seen in a game. Sure, its twists and turns might not feel entirely surprising if you’re an RPG connoisseur, but no other game captures such a specific vibe.

Even the artwork is witty, transforming everything from a toaster to a treadmill into attractive humans in wildly clever and creative ways. </p><p>The second and most important reason I loved this game is that <em>Date Everything</em> is a cavalcade of virtuoso voice acting that must be heard to be appreciated. I&#39;ve played a bunch of visual novels without voiceover where the writing alone wasn&#39;t strong enough to make the characters pop, as well as voiced ones where middling performances detracted from the story. <em>Date Everything</em>&#39;s cast of 100 of the best in the business make their dialogue shine (and like I said, the dialogue is really damn good). </p><p>There are some endearingly obvious casting choices. The horny clothes dryer? Yeah, it&#39;s Neil Newbon, who probably charmed your pants off as Astarion in <em>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3</em>. Your D&amp;D dice set? It couldn&#39;t be anyone but Matt Mercer. On the flip side, Cherami Lee as perky Chairemi (yep, your chairs) was unrecognizable from her stellar turn as V in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. Laura Bailey has voiced countless heroines over the years, so the last place I expected to hear her was screaming her lungs out as one half of the toxic relationship playing out in your laundry room. Whether you&#39;re looking for love or laughs, <em>Date Everything</em> is a marvelous showcase of talents that often go underappreciated in gaming. </p><p><em>— A.W.</em></p><h2 id="6b104842-e66d-4e86-add8-63b2aa3b6094">Despelote</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oVdmFEG_MuI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Having grown up with grandparents from South America, I&#39;m familiar with a flavor of soccer fanaticism that hasn&#39;t quite taken root in the US.

He decides to manage a group of former villains for SDN (the Superhero Dispatch Network), hoping to imbue them with his own ideals of heroism. By day, you assign them to deal with crimes around Los Angeles, but through conversations and crucial Telltale decisions, you also encourage them to work as a team and hopefully become better people (or mutants).

There was something to do around almost every corner and some of the game&#39;s many secrets were well-hidden. That&#39;s not to say the game&#39;s plot is anything to sniff at: this is a brutal tale of revenge, featuring rich writing and performances. </p><p>The open-world format is a little at odds with protagonist Atsu’s steely desire for vengeance, but Ghost of Yōtei is beautifully orchestrated enough for that to be a minor complaint. The combat is stellar — to be most effective, you’ll need to swap between weapons to counter what your current opponent is wielding. Still, I couldn’t help but use the kusarigama whenever possible, especially to carry out stealthy assassinations from a distance. Strengthening Atsu’s bond with a wild wolf that becomes an ally in combat is also a highlight, while the deeply customizable difficulty settings are very welcome.</p><p>Like its predecessor, <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, this is a technical masterpiece.

The second thing to know is that you are no longer Zagreus, but Melinoë, princess of the underworld, and if you are a gay woman this game exists to roast you mercilessly. </p><p>Zag was a lovable himbo engaged in a petty dispute against his father and free to romance a variety of Greek gods along the way. By contrast the world around Mel is coming apart at the seams, and her dating options are considerably less satisfying. Several of her in-game relationships with women are written to be warm and reciprocal, but of course they&#39;re with the found family of deities who support her. Nemesis and Eris, her two options for romance, seem to actively hate her and, after dozens of runs, are never interested in anything beyond a threadbare situationship. </p><p>Juggling two different mission paths with their own distinct enemies and biomes is a treat — as are the new, sometimes brutally hard bosses.

You act as a set of pinching fingers that lifts and places shape-people in their preferred seats — on the bus, in a restaurant, at a movie theater and so on. Each person has preferences (window seat, no bad smells, wants to read) and attributes (forgot to shower, plays loud music) that mesh or conflict.</p><p>Tiny accessories and icons not only make each shape more adorable, they help keep track of some of their proclivities. Bubbly smiles or heartbreaking frowns tell you whether you’ve met a seated shape’s needs, and tapping on them tells you exactly what they want. A simple story involving a few of the shapes and an indie film takes form as you advance levels, but for the most part, you’re just checking in on what people want and arranging them to optimize happiness. </p><p>I obsessively plowed through the game, soothed by the strummy music, delighted by the plops, bloops and chatters of the sound effects. As more people get on the bus (show up to the coworking space, arrive at the restaurant) it gets increasingly tougher to satisfy everyone — more than once I had to clear everyone off the train and start from scratch — but achieving 100 percent contentment is always possible.

It may have some issues, but <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> is still worth experiencing.</p><p><em>— N.I.</em></p><h2 id="6c2a35b1-5ee3-4004-bdef-5c4be1ab784a">Ninja Gaiden Ragebound</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/16cO1alUFkE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>I&#39;d somehow never played a single Ninja Gaiden game until this year, but I could hardly have had a better introduction to the series.

Dual protagonists Kinji Monzu and Kumori (whose souls fuse together) have distinct abilities that work in harmony, and using the right tools to tackle each enemy helps charge up a powerful hyper attack. <em>Ragebound</em> isn&#39;t necessarily easy, but it isn&#39;t frustrating either — unless you&#39;re trying to put it down and do something else, because this is a very absorbing, entertaining game.</p><p><em>— K.H. </em></p><h2 id="3fa0ef3d-c9e9-4da7-8e28-c42dfacdbab5">Peak</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jrlUVhLBjG0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p></p><p><em>Peak</em> perfectly captures the delightful, simultaneous disasters that can happen when multiple people make stupid decisions at the same time. Ostensibly a multiplayer game about child scouts who crash land on a deserted island and are forced to climb to the top of a mountain to get rescued, <em>Peak</em>&#39;s multitude of dangerous biomes, status-affecting consumables and hidden secrets make it fun to get you and your friends killed. The game is an awkward first-person platformer where it&#39;s sometimes easier to shoot someone out of a cannon than it is to get them to toddle up a hill, but those obstacles feel good to overcome because the game lets you talk to people while you do it. </p><p>The term <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://aftermath.site/friendslop-peak-lethal-company-social-media-discourse/" data-i13n="cpos:33;pos:1">&#34;friendslop&#34;</a> was coined following the popularity of <em>Peak</em> and games like it, a burgeoning micro-genre where games with deceptively simple virtual tasks are paired with proximity-based voice chat. Unsurprisingly, it&#39;s fun to play video games with your friends, but <em>Peak</em> stands out because the ongoing support of developers Aggro Crab and Landfall has managed to keep things interesting in the game for nearly half the year.</p><p><em>— I.C.C.</em></p><h2 id="d7c6503f-6124-4fa3-9eed-d4c818cbdb72">Oblivion Remaster</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFJ3PZuAjK4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>There&#39;s a comfort in knowing exactly what you&#39;re going to get from a game. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2623190/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Remastered/" data-i13n="cpos:34;pos:1"><em>The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</em> </a>delivers all the things I love about Bethesda creations. It&#39;s a world I want to get lost in, where the detours are the true point of the journey. I become a stealth archer cat person who can cause chaos or save the day. And I can enjoy the studio&#39;s signature open-world RPG experience without suffering through the wonky design ideas that made the original game frustrating. For Bethesda fans, this remaster is a joy whether it&#39;s your first time playing <em>Oblivion</em> or your fiftieth.</p><p><em>— A.W.</em></p><h2 id="200d2f37-aa9f-43b8-b319-e1977f09bf6f">Öoo</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/35CudH2qKJ8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>I have a deep appreciation for games that give you a limited set of tools and many ways to use them. Puzzle-platformer <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-brilliant-puzzle-platformer-enter-the-gungeon-on-mobile-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110042847.html" data-i13n="cpos:35;pos:1"><em>Öoo</em></a> is a brilliantly constructed example of that. It&#39;s so thoughtfully crafted that even the name is perfect. The large Ö looks like the caterpillar character you control and the smaller characters resemble the two bombs that you drag around and use to solve a variety of conundrums. Öoo is also the noise I involuntarily made when I solved some of the puzzles.</p><p>Nama Takahashi (who made Öoo with help from Tiny Cactus Studio and Tsuyomi) uses deeply clever level design to teach you how to use the bombs and move forward. Takahashi clearly wants you to succeed. Checkpoints are everywhere, so if you die while trying to find a puzzle solution, there&#39;s no lengthy runback to worry about. The developer (who previously created ElecHead) even made his <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PA3w0GnpAo" data-i13n="cpos:36;pos:1">own walkthrough video</a> to help you get to the end.</p><p><em>Öoo</em> — which you can complete in a single sitting — respects your time. It looks and sounds wonderful too. The music reminds me a lot of the outstanding <em>Poinpy</em>. While I remain sad that it&#39;s not currently possible to play that game, I&#39;m more than happy to have <em>Öoo</em> to return to.</p><p><em>— K.H.</em></p><h2 id="8de8144c-5a06-4d8f-92ca-ede81a7425ee">Silksong</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>It’s such a relief to know that, finally, this is probably the last time I’ll write about <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/" data-i13n="cpos:37;pos:1"><em>Silksong</em></a>.

Seven years in the making, from DLC to standalone game to Reddit meme, <em>Silksong</em> arrived across pretty much every mainstream gaming platform. </p><p>The <em>Hollow Knight</em> sequel swaps to a new protagonist, Hornet, who was a recurring boss in the original. She’s faster, she can attack in diagonal dives, and just plays pretty differently from the Knight. Off the back of the slowburn hit of <em>Hollow Knight</em>, Team Cherry have lavished more attention, more fun and more diverse boss battles, ensuring this feels like a better (although possibly more challenging) game. </p><p>I prefer the faster, risk-and-reward playstyle too. Hornet uses silk to heal, which, like soul in <em>Hollow Knight</em>, you build up by attacking enemies. However, Hornet does this in bulk, healing three hearts at once. When you die, you’ll leave a bounty of silk behind, making for a tempting health top-up you can grab mid-boss fight. If you don’t die before then. </p><p>You can equip Hornet with different weapon and subweapon loadouts, adding a little more variety in this sequel. Heavy, slower weapon swings, or relentless strikes with a much shorter range? Your choice.</p><p>When it launched, half the Engadget team were sharing tales of bottlenecks and seemingly impossible boss fights, and we were all exploring the world of <em>Silksong</em> in entirely different directions. That’s the blessing and the curse of a Hollow Knight game. </p><p><em>— Mat Smith, UK Bureau Chief</em></p><h2 id="2871bf9c-031e-4a61-9aee-c0fc66f8f6ee">Silent Hill f</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z1e1gmnNoj8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>It’s a rare and special thing when a horror game lives up to the gruesome promises of its cinematic teaser trailer, and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2947440/SILENT_HILL_f/" data-i13n="cpos:39;pos:1"><em>Silent Hill f</em></a> accomplishes this and more. <em>Silent Hill f</em> is a heart-pounding survival-horror game set in a rural Japanese village in the 1960s and starring Hinako, a high school student with crappy friends and a tormented home life. Hinako’s town is ravaged by demonic creatures and an infectious botanical fungus, and she has to fight her way through it, shifting among realities and encountering a cast of untrustworthy peers and fox worshippers. The combat starts out great and only gets better as Hinako sacrifices her flesh in the name of salvation, meaning the body horror steadily ramps up as the game progresses. Hinako’s world is filled with terrifying mannequin minions, bulbous pus monsters and disturbing, trypophobic visuals. It’s beautiful.</p><p><em>— J.C.</em></p><h2 id="bb35f1c8-c25d-4f1e-8031-1eb67c6a8c1b">Subway Builder</h2><figure><img src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-12-19_at_09.34.28.jpg" data-crop-orig-src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2025-12-19_at_09.34.28.jpg" style="height:1281px;width:2560px;" alt="Subway Builder" data-uuid="f1d8d419-8d6b-402d-b1b4-89da04351e93"/><figcaption>Subway Builder</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Aaron Souppouris</div></figure><p><a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.subwaybuilder.com/" data-i13n="cpos:40;pos:1"><em>Subway Builder</em></a> is an indie transport sim like no other. Creator Colin Miller combined OpenStreet maps of large cities with government data about where people live and work. This creates a complex web of nodes representing residents and workplaces for you to connect. You’ll start with no public transport infrastructure and try to build out a profitable network. In dense cities like New York this is incredibly easy, but freeing even 20 percent of Phoenix&#39;s endless sprawl from cars without going bust is very challenging. </p><p>The game scratches the same itch for me as <em>Mini Metro</em>, only instead of cutesy vector graphics you&#39;re basically working in Google Maps. It&#39;s also expanding at a rapid pace: When I first played in October, there were maybe 15 locations, and as of writing there are now 29 US cities and, most recently, five UK options. I spent the first 35 years of my life bouncing around Croydon and Lewisham in London; giving South Londoners a proper tube network (while ignoring anything north of Highbury) has been a real treat.</p><p><em>— A.S. </em></p><h2 id="f1cc4d3a-18ff-4a4e-907c-9d687d536e1c">Sword of the Sea</h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KXUmt8SPfJk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>While the game might always be evoked in the same breath as <em>Journey</em>, the PlayStation classic <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/sword-of-the-sea-is-what-happens-when-matt-nava-strides-back-into-journeys-shadow-233148894.html" data-i13n="cpos:41;pos:1">with which it shares a key creative</a>, <em>Sword of the Sea</em> is more than just another beautiful trek towards a mountain. Combining delectable traversal mechanics from <em>The Pathless</em> and beautiful sea creatures like those in <em>Abzu</em>, the game is a culmination of everything developer Giant Squid is good at. More importantly, though, <em>Sword of the Sea</em>&#39;s surfing mechanic just looks and feels damn cool.</p><p>I don&#39;t know that I ever mastered how to surf on a sword during <em>Sword of the Sea</em>&#39;s silent and surprisingly brief narrative, but I do know it didn&#39;t take long to care. Carving through sand and snow immediately came easy enough that getting to any of the game&#39;s intriguing landmarks and collectibles was a matter of how, not if. That&#39;s not to discredit the game&#39;s other charms, like a score from Austin Wintory and a photo mode that&#39;s perfect for capturing close encounters with dolphins, whales and sharks. If you need a reason to play <em>Sword of the Sea</em>, though, let it be the surfing. It tells you more about the game and what it wants you to feel than any piece of dialogue could.</p><p><em>— I.C.C. </em></p><h2 id="3e7ef8d8-c3e1-48b7-b118-f4f96460c918">Sworn </h2><div><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dm80m4hjWqY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-provider-name="youtube"></iframe></div></div><p>Let&#39;s get one thing out of the way.

The combat is extremely addictive and there are multiple character classes that truly change how everything plays. </p><p>Some characters are for up close combat and others are better at dropping turrets and related items that do damage over time. It&#39;s super fun to litter a bunch of poison-soaked cannons in a level and just let them do their thing. It also has four-player co-op, which is chaotic in all the best ways. The story is totally forgettable when compared to <em>Hades</em>, but that&#39;s not why I play roguelites. </p><p><em>— L.B. </em></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/engadgets-favorite-games-of-2025-153000109.html?src=rss</body></html>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With Dropbox, for instance, you can “gather insights, prepare briefs and summarize reports or internal documents,” using ChatGPT’s smarts, according to the description.

      <guid>d709f598-e69a-4612-a3fd-2cee819d1bf0</guid>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 12:00:02 +0000</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX said it experienced an anomaly with one if its Starlink satellites that was likely caused by a small explosion. &quot;The anomaly led to venting of the propulsion tank, a rapid decay in semi-major axis by about 4 km [2.5 miles] and the release of a small number of trackable low relatively velocity objects,&quot; Starlink wrote in a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/2001691802911289712">post on X</a>. Orbital tracking company LeoLabs <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://x.com/LeoLabs_Space/status/2001760508979089448">assessed</a> that the issue was caused by an &quot;internal energetic source rather than a collision with space debris or another object.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>SpaceX said it&#39;s working with NASA and the US Space Force to track the remains of the object. &quot;The satellite is largely intact, tumbling and will reenter the Earth&#39;s atmosphere and fully demise within weeks,&quot; the company said. It&#39;s trajectory is well below the International Space Station (ISS) so it poses no risk to the lab or its crew. Starlink has yet to say how many pieces it&#39;s tracking.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The incident happened just days after a Starlink satellite <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/12/16/elon-musks-starlink-satellites-narrowly-avoid-collision-with-chinese-ones">narrowly avoided</a> a collision with a rival Chinese satellite from CAS Space last week.

Orbital tracking company LeoLabs <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://x.com/LeoLabs_Space/status/2001760508979089448">assessed</a> that the issue was caused by an &#34;internal energetic source rather than a collision with space debris or another object.&#34; </p>
<p>SpaceX said it&#39;s working with NASA and the US Space Force to track the remains of the object. &#34;The satellite is largely intact, tumbling and will reenter the Earth&#39;s atmosphere and fully demise within weeks,&#34; the company said.

<h2 id="jump-link-dac-faqs">DAC FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-does-dac-stand-for"><strong>What does DAC stand for?</strong></h3> 
<p>DAC stands for digital to analogue converter. A digital-to-analog converter takes the digital (D) music from your phone or computer and converts (C) it into analog (A) sound you can hear. All phones and PCs have them, but since handsets moved to USB-C, Lightning or Bluetooth for music, the task of converting that signal was generally outsourced to either your adapter or your wireless headphones.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>DACs can be used with phones, laptops and desktops but tend to be much simpler than a regular external audio interface. One basic distinction is that DACs are usually for listening only whereas an audio interface might have ports to plug in microphones and instruments (but an external audio interface is also technically a DAC). Some high-end DACs even include XLR outputs for better connectivity with professional audio equipment.</p> 
<p>The best DACs tend to be lightweight, making them more suitable for mobile use, although it still gets a little tricky with the iPhone as you still might need to add another dongle to make it play nice with Lightning. Also, not all DACs support all the higher audio resolutions like DSD. Most standalone DACs require external power or an onboard battery, though some can use the power from whatever you plug them into — in which case expect a hit to your battery life.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-why-do-i-need-new-hardware-to-listen-to-music"><strong>Why do I need new hardware to listen to music?</strong></h3> 
<p>The short answer is, you don’t. You can play “hi-res” audio files on most phones and PCs, you just might not be getting the full experience. If your device’s audio interface tops out at 44.1 or 48kHz (which is fairly common and covers the vast majority of music online) then that’s the experience you’ll get. If you want to enjoy better sounding music at a higher sample rate and bit-depth (aka resolution), you’ll need an interface that supports it and wired headphones, potentially using a headphone amp for an enhanced experience.</p> 
<p>It’s worth pointing out that “lossless” and “hi-res” are related terms, but not the same thing and will vary from service to service. Apple uses ALAC encoding which is compressed, but without “loss” to the quality (unlike the ubiquitous .aac or .mp3 file formats). CDs were generally mastered to at least 16-bit / 44.1kHz which is the benchmark that Apple is using for its definition of lossless. In audio circles, a general consensus is that hi-res is anything with a sample rate above 44.1kHz. Increasingly, though, the term is being used for anything 96kHz and above.</p> 
<p>This, of course, isn’t only about Apple’s new streaming formats. External DACs and audio interfaces are a great way to get the best sound and upgrade your listening experience generally. Especially if you want to get into the world of more exotic (read: pricey) headphones, as they often even require a DAC to provide enough clean digital signal to drive them. For audiophile headphones, a phone or laptop’s internal sound chipset often doesn’t have the oomph needed to deliver a hi-fi experience, meaning a better DAC could make all the difference in sound quality.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-okay-but-cant-i-just-use-the-headphone-adapter-for-my-phone"><strong>Okay, but can’t I just use the headphone adapter for my phone?</strong></h3> 
<p>No. Well, yes, but see above. A Lightning or USB-C to 3.5mm headphone adapter often is an audio interface and most of the ones you’re buying for $7 (or that come free in the box) do not support hi-res audio beyond 48kHz / 24-bit. Android is a little more complicated, as some adapters are “passive” and really just connect you to the phone’s internal DAC like old school headphones. Others (active ones) have a DAC built-in and good luck finding out what your specific phone and the in-box adapter delivers. (Hint: connect it to a PC and see if it comes up as an audio interface. You might find some details there if it does).</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-about-bluetooth-headphones"><strong>What about Bluetooth headphones?</strong></h3> 
<p>Chances are that over the last few years you’ve migrated from wired to wireless headphones (thanks, Apple). The world of Bluetooth headphones changes things a little when it comes to seeking better audio performance. What matters here is twofold, the headphones you’re using (as those will technically be the “DAC”) and the codec — the method used to send the musical data over to the headphones.</p> 
<p>It’s also worth checking to see if your headphones support aptX and which version. Look out for aptX HD, aptX Adaptive and (for the highest quality) aptX Lossless which are all better than standard and becoming more common, albeit slowly. It’s worth noting that both your phone or media player <em>and</em> your headphones need to support the same aptX codec. Currently, no iPhone supports any type of aptX, though dongles exist that will offer that functionality.</p> 
<p>Other higher-resolution Bluetooth codecs exist, like Sony’s LDAC, but Qualcomm’s AptX has wider support thanks to its prevalence in Android devices. Some high-end wireless headphones might even come with a headphone jack for wired connections when higher-quality audio is needed.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/the-best-dac-for-lossless-high-resolution-music-iphone-android-160056147.html?src=rss]]></description>

Schulz. That’s a 41 percent stake Sony is buying from Canadian firm WildBrain. Since Sony bought 39 percent of the franchise back in 2018, this will give the company an 80 percent stake. The deal is still subject to regulatory approvals, but Peanuts will become Sony’s consolidated subsidiary once it’s closed. Schulz’s family still owns the remaining 20 percent stake in the franchise. </p><p>Schulz launched the Peanuts universe in comic strips 75 years ago, back in 1950. The franchise has grown massively since then, spawning animated series, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/apple-tv-releases-the-first-peanuts-musical-in-37-years-130003599.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">cartoon musicals</a> and movies that made Snoopy a household name. The company said that it has focused on expanding the Peanuts IP since it bought 39 percent of the brand years ago. “With this additional ownership stake, we are thrilled to be able to further elevate the value of the ʻPEANUTSʼ brand by drawing on the Sony Groupʼs extensive global network and collective expertise,” Sony Music Entertainment Japan CEO Shunsuke Muramatsu added. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/sony-is-buying-peanuts-022341467.html?src=rss</body></html>]]></content:encoded>
